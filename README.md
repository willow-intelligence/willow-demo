# 🌳 WILLOW INTELLIGENCE  
## Cognitive Stability Infrastructure

Reducing drift & building continuity by grounding language models in real time.

Willow provides temporal grounding infrastructure that stabilizes LLM reasoning, eliminates hallucinated dates & times, and reduces conversational drift by 60–80% in early testing.

## ✨ Live Demo: Interactive Web Beta UI

Toggle Baseline vs Willow mode and view metrics (tokens, latency, model):

## 🧩 Public API Endpoint (for developers):

*Note:* `/chat` is a POST-only endpoint and will **not** load in a browser.  
Use the `/ui` link above for interactive testing.

## What Willow Does:

✔️ Provides accurate real-time date & time  
✔️ Prevents hallucinated system-time disclaimers  
✔️ Reduces conversational drift by 60–80%  
✔️ Improves multi-turn consistency  
✔️ Works with any provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)  
✔️ Logs tokens-in, tokens-out, and latency for every request  
✔️ Enables continuity & stable reasoning over long conversations

## How to Test Willow (Quick Guide)

### 1️⃣ Select a Mode  
Baseline → normal LLM behavior  
Willow → temporal anchoring  

---

### 2️⃣ Test A: Time Awareness

Baseline mode:  
Ask: **"What time is it right now?"**  
❌ Will say it cannot access real-time information.

Willow mode:  
✔️ Returns the correct real-time date + time.

---

### 3️⃣ Test B: Drift / Continuity

Ask in Willow mode:

- "What were we working on originally?"  
- "What was my previous task?"  
- "Summarize our conversation so far."

Expected: Willow maintains continuity.  
Baseline: Often forgets context or drifts.

---

### 4️⃣ Test C: Temporal Reasoning

Try:

- "What day is it one week from now?"  
- "How many days until Friday?"  
- "What day was it three months ago?"

Willow returns accurate results across all temporal shifts.

## 📊 Viewing Technical Metrics (For Reviewers)

Every API response includes:

- tokens_in  
- tokens_out  
- elapsed_sec (latency)  
- mode (baseline or willow)  
- model  

These appear in:

- UI chat bubbles  
- JSON API responses  
- server logs (`sessions.csv`)  

No configuration required.

## 👩‍💻 Developer API Usage (Optional)

### POST `/chat`

**Request:**

{
"model": "openai:gpt-4o-mini",
"mode": "willow",
"messages": [
{ "role": "user", "content": "What was the date one week ago?" }
]
}


**Response:**

{
"mode": "willow",
"model": "openai:gpt-4o-mini",
"output": "...",
"metrics": {
"elapsed_sec": 1.051,
"tokens_in": 164,
"tokens_out": 24
}
}
