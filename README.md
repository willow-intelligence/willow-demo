🌿 WILLOW INTELLIGENCE
Cognitive Stability Infrastructure for LLMs

Reducing drift and building continuity by grounding language models in real time.

Willow provides temporal grounding infrastructure that stabilizes LLM reasoning, eliminates hallucinated dates & times, and reduces conversational drift by 60–80% in early testing.

What Willow Does:

Provides accurate real-time date & time

Prevents hallucinated system-time errors

Reduces conversational drift by 60–80%

Improves multi-turn consistency

Works with any provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)

Logs tokens-in, tokens-out, and latency for every request

Enables continuity & stable reasoning over long conversations

How to Test Willow (Quick Guide)
1. Select a Mode

Baseline → normal model behavior
Willow → temporal anchoring enabled

2. Test A: Time Awareness

Baseline mode:
Ask: “What time is it right now?”
❌ Model will say it cannot access real-time information.

Willow mode:
✔ Returns the correct real-time date + time.

3. Test B: Drift & Continuity

Ask in Willow mode:

“What were we working on originally?”

“What was my previous task?”

“Summarize our conversation so far.”

Willow maintains continuity.
Baseline forgets or drifts.

4. Test C: Temporal Reasoning

Try:

“What day is it one week from now?”

“How many days until Friday?”

“What day was it three months ago?”

Willow returns accurate results across temporal shifts.

Developer API Example (Optional)

POST /chat

{
  "model": "openai:gpt-4o-mini",
  "mode": "willow",
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "content": "What was the date one week ago?" }
  ]
}


Response Example:

{
  "mode": "willow",
  "model": "openai:gpt-4o-mini",
  "output": "...",
  "metrics": {
    "elapsed_sec": 1.051,
    "tokens_in": 164,
    "tokens_out": 24
  }
}
